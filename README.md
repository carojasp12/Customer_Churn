Churning
Churning refers to the phenomenon where customers or employees stop using a product or service, or leave a company. This is often seen as a negative metric, indicating dissatisfaction or better opportunities elsewhere. Churning is particularly significant in subscription-based businesses, where customer retention is crucial for revenue stability.

Non-Churning
Non-churning refers to customers or employees who remain loyal to a company or continue to use its products or services over time. Non-churning is indicative of satisfaction, value perception, and strong relationships.
